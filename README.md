# Funkin' Laser

A rewritten / revamped version of Psych Engine.

This rewrite includes:

* Gameplay Modifiers
* New options such as hitsounds
* Improved UI
* New gameplay mechanics
* Winning Icons?
* More Lua variables :)

This engine uses Psych Engine 0.6.

Sadly, this engine only supports x64-based machines (I think) so... Sad day for all of 32-based machine users :(

***PS: Read COMPILING.md for instructions on how to build the engine.***

Happy Modding! <3
