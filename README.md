# Funkin' Laser

A rewritten / revamped version of Psych Engine.

## This rewrite includes

* Gameplay Modifiers
* New options such as hitsounds
* Improved UI
* New gameplay mechanics
* Winning Icons?
* More Lua variables :)

This engine uses Psych Engine 0.4.2, meaning you can compile it with an older version of Haxe, like 4.1.5 and so on.

It also supports 0.5.2, 0.6 and onwards, but do bare in mind that we barely update these supported versions.

Sadly, this engine only supports x64-based machines (I think) so... Sad day for all of 32-based machine users :(

***PS: Read COMPILING.md for instructions on how to build the engine.***
