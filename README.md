# Funkin' Laser

A rewritten / revamped version of Psych Engine.

This rewrite includes:

* Gameplay Modifiers
* New options such as hitsounds
* Improved UI
* New gameplay mechanics
* Winning Icons?
* More Lua variables :)

This engine uses Psych Engine 0.4.2, meaning you can compile it with an older version of Haxe, like 4.1.5 and so on.

***PS: Read COMPILING.md for instructions on how to build the engine.***
